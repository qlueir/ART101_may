<h3>Once upon a time, there lived The Guppy. He lived in a beautiful and peaceful pond.</h3>

    His friend, a kitty cat, came by to visit. Kitty cat slapped the water. "Knock Knock" <br>
    "Who's there?" Guppy cried out. <br>
    "Meow" <br>
    "Meow who" <br>
    "It's meow or never! Lemme in." Guppy felt a shiver go down his back.
    This is odd, he doesn't have any friends and stays inside all the time. Who could this be?
    Guppy looked through the peephole and there, The Kitty Cat was staring back.

    <p class="showtext">Guppy's heart dropped. Cat was much bigger than Guppy was and it's a well known fact that cats enjoy the taste of fish. Guppy ducked under cover and kept a close eye on his front door.</p>

          What the Kitty Cat didn't know is that Guppy is a
          <strong> proud American</strong> with strong advocay for the second amendment. Guppy is
          <strong> armed and dangerous</strong>.
          Guppy held tightly to his <strong>Pump-Action Shotgun,</strong>

          <i>A tried-and-true choice, the pump-action shotgun provides
          reliability at a reasonable price. It requires manual action 
          to eject and load shells. Ideal for hunting, sport shooting, and most importantly home defense.</i>
